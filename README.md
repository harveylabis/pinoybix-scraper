# pinoybix-scraper
A script to scrape the questions and answers in [PinoyBix](https://pinoybix.org/) saved as a json file. 
By using additional scripts, this can be used to generate a lot of review questions.

## Folder Description:
- questions: where the resulting json file will be placed.

## File Description:
- pinoyBix_scraper.py: the main script used to scrape questions and corresponsing answer key
- requirements.txt: dependecies
- url_links_orig.json: containts the links needed to scrape; mostly are related to electronics
- url_links.json: put the links here that you want to scrape
- questions/testing.py: test script to print question and answer pair

PS. I have contacted the owner of PinoyBix and agreed to the idea of this.
